        About Me:
      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is Janet, and I was meant to travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd known it for a long time, but I'd never actually been able to
        experience the beauty of traveling, of immersing oneself fully in
        something and somewhere so unique and special and entirely captivating.
        <br />
        Little did I know, an extreme bout of depression was just the thing to
        help awaken my passion for exploration. <br />
        Towards the end of my sophomore year of college I decided a change was
        in order, and it was then that I began researching and applying to
        various Study Abroad programs. <br />
        I'll spare you the details, but fast-forward a few short months and I
        found out I was accepted to the yearlong program at the prestigious
        Trinity College Dublin. <br />

        I had never been out of the country, so needless to say I was incredibly
        excited to start my journey. <br />
        <br />
        And I had decided on Ireland for a few specific reasons (in no
        particular order): <br />

        <li>I have ancestors from Ireland (I know, I know, we all do...)</li>

          <li>(Turns out, I'm around 50% Irish!)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I love the rain</li>
        <li>Who doesn't love an accent?</li>

        And it's in Dublin where my adventures truly began. <br />
        <br />
        My very first night in town, I went to buy a SIM-card for my phone and
        somehow got lost, wandering around and around the park that I soon
        realized was only a five minute walk from my apartment. <br />
        Soon enough, I joined some university organizations, found myself a job,
        and got started with my studies. I made sure that I was always ahead on
        my assigned readings, because I wanted to be able to use long weekends
        and bank holidays for local European travel. With the first opportunity
        I had, I went on a trip spanning three-countries, all visited in under
        one week. This pattern repeated every time I had a momentary break from
        school, and while some trips are more memorable than others, all of them
        helped to fuel my wanderlust. It was when I returned home from my time
        abroad that I made
