            I celebrated my 22nd birthday the same summer I moved to NYC for the
            first time. I had finally settled into an apartment with other
            people in my teaching program, and we had been out and exploring
            Brooklyn when I came across the bar that I'd eventually throw my
            birthday party at! Turns out, the bar is also in the neighborhood I
            ended up moving to, and have lived in for the better part of five
            years now. To me, the best part of this birthday was the ability to
            merge my worlds together - I had friends from home, friends from
            college, and new friends from my teaching program all come together
            to celebrate as we closed out our first summer before real-life
            began.

            Another promise I made myself was that I'd return to Ireland every
            two years to see my friends and explore new regions of the country.
            This trip was the first time I went back to Dublin since leaving
            from study abroad. I spent a few nights in Dublin before going off
            to explore other parts of the country, but came back into town to
            see Riverdance on the eve of my 22nd birthday. The next day, I
            boarded a ferry for Scotland. After spending a few days in and
            around Edinborough, I made my way to London. My final stop on this
            trip was in Copenhagen, Denmark. I saw and did a lot on this trip,
            so it's practically impossible to pick a favorite place/meal/memory.

            Let me start by saying I do not do well in warm weather. And Spain &
            Portugal during the months of July and August are more than just
            warm...This trip took me all over the country of Spain (my friends
            and I basically drove around in a counterclockwise spiral, starting
            from Madrid and then up to Bilbao before beginning the spiral). Some
            of my work friends (and their friends) joined for various parts of
            this trip, so every place we visited felt different based on who we
            were visiting with. From NW Spain, we went down through Portugal,
            before heading back into Spain via Seville. The year we took this
            trip was the year of the terrorist attack in Barcelona, so we were
            all a little on-edge, but it was a great experience overall.

            To date, this is still one of my favorite trips. While I feel very
            fortunate to have traveled throughout much of Europe, I felt as
            though I hadn't experienced enough of my own continent. So for
            birthday 26, I decided I was going to rent a car and drive down
            Highway 1. I definitely took the scenic route for this trip! I
            started up in Canada and explored Whistler (better known for winter
            visits) and Vancouver before taking the Amtrak Cascades train down
            into Seattle. From there, I rented a car and drove around the
            surrounding areas. Unexpectedly, my favorite part of this trip was
            Portland. The people were all super friendly and super weird and it
            was just my kind of vibe. The coastal drive is something I truly
            will never forget.

            This was an emotional birthday/trip/place. When my mom and her
            siblings were younger, her parents owned a house on this lake (which
            they eventually sold). When my cousins and I were kids, my
            grandparents would rent a house on the lake to have the family come
            and visit (all the cousins - the house was always packed). My
            grandfather died when I was 10 years old, so I hadn't been back to
            the lake in 17 years. As a place, Beaver Lake holds so many fond
            memories for me, and I thought it would be nice to stay around my
            family for once (as they never come on my birthday trips). So my mom
            and two of her siblings divvied up a two-month rental of a house on
            this lake, and we took turns living there throughout the summer.
            Unfortunately, my mom hurt her back pretty badly while staying at
            the lake, so she was unable to sleep there for most of the vacation.
            My parents would drive home every night, sleep there, and then drive
            the 40 minutes back to the lake the next day. Even though I intended
            to spend much of this summer with my parents, I actually ended up
            spending most of it alone. Still, Beaver Lake is one of my favorite
            places, but mostly for the memories it holds. I'm not sure I'll be
            strong enough to visit again.

            I turn 28 on August 8th. This is one day after my teaching
            commitment with Upperline comes to an end. I had originally planned
            to do a trip to and through Colorado for my birthday, but with all
            of the uncertainty in the world right now, I don't think that's
            going to happen. Instead, I'll probably go visit my best friend (see
            above), who just moved into her new house with her husband and
            doggos.
